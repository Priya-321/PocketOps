NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is a field of study that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves using computer algorithms to analyze, understand, and generate human language in a way that is both useful and meaningful to humans. NLP is used in a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots. It is a rapidly evolving field that draws on techniques from computer science, artificial 
intelligence, and linguistics, among other disciplines.

# Resume screening using python NLP from pdf
There are several steps involved in building a Python code for resume screening using NLP from PDF. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

Extract text from PDF: You can use a Python library like PyPDF2 or pdfminer to extract text from a PDF file.

Preprocess the text: You'll need to clean up the extracted text by removing any unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words. You can use a Python library like NLTK for this.

Build a dictionary of keywords: Create a list of keywords relevant to the job position you are hiring for. You can also use a pre-built list of keywords from a third-party source.

Score the resumes: Use a scoring algorithm to assign a score to each resume based on the frequency of keywords found in the text. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or cosine similarity for this.

Sort and display the results: Sort the resumes based on their scores and display the top candidates.
